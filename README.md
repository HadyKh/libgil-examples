=================

LibIGL, short for "librairie for Geometric Learning," is an open-source C++ library that focuses on geometry processing and computational geometry. It provides a wide range of tools and algorithms for working with 2D and 3D geometric data, making it a valuable resource for computer graphics, computer-aided design (CAD), robotics, and various other fields that involve manipulating and analyzing geometric shapes.

### Some of the key features and functionalities of LibIGL include:
===================================================================

> 1. **Mesh Processing**: 
    - LibIGL allows you to manipulate and process 3D triangle and tetrahedral meshes. This includes operations like mesh simplification, smoothing, parameterization, and remeshing.

> 2. **Geometry Representation**:
    - The library provides data structures and functions for working with various geometric representations, such as points, lines, curves, surfaces, and volumes.

> 3. **Mesh Editing**:
    - You can use LibIGL to perform operations like mesh deformation, mesh segmentation, and mesh alignment.

> 4. **Numerical Solvers**:
    - It includes solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) commonly used in geometry processing, as well as linear and nonlinear optimization routines.

> 5. **Visualization**:
    - LibIGL offers tools for visualizing geometric data and results, making it easier to understand and debug algorithms.

> 6. **Integration with Other Libraries**:
    - It can be integrated with other libraries like Eigen (for linear algebra), CGAL (for computational geometry), Visualization Toolkit (VTK), and other popular C++ libraries.

> 7. **Python bindings**:
    - LibIGL can be used with Python through its Python bindings, which allow you to access LibIGL's functionality within a Python environment. These Python bindings make it easier for Python developers to take advantage of LibIGL's geometric processing capabilities without writing C++ code directly.
